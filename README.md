My name is Olivia and I'm a **web developer**. I come from a static media design background, from which I switched to development in 2016. Frontend is my passion but I mostly work with the full stack. Your databases don't scare me.

Ever passionate about my work, I continuously look for new challenges. I am analytical, autonomous, always happy to learn, and I prosper in a cooperative environment.

I've spent most of my time on php projects. Don't feel too bad for me, php7+ is pretty cool. I dream of working with Rails/Vue.js again someday. I love to tinker with python in my free time.

I currently weave php/Yii2 for a living.

I'm also less serious than what I initially look like :)
