My name is Olivia and I'm a **full stack developer**. I come from a static media design background, from which I switched to web development in 2016. As a designer, I have a soft spot for frontend but I mostly work with the full stack. Your databases don't scare me.

I've spent most of my time on php projects. Don't feel too bad for me, php7+ is pretty cool. I do hope to work with Rails/Vue.js again someday. I love to tinker with python in my free time.

I currently weave php/Yii2 for a living.

I'm also less serious than what I initially look like :)
